 #Our first game engine... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Cetroleopter Engine its a 3D graphics Engine for Game Development developped with C++ developped by Alvaro Milla & Alexandre Carreras.

### Engine Features:

## UI:

-**File**: where you can save and load the configuration, and also can exit the engine (I don't know why you would do that, taking in account how great our engine is 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))

-**Edit**: here you can hide and show the settings window and the console window. The settings window has window settings, FPS setings and harware specifics. The console window just reads the console and print it. You can also load preselected fbx files with their respective Textures.

-**Create**: this option offers a varietty of primitives to load into our the engine such as a cube or a cone.

-**View**: this tab may be one of the most interesting ones. It displays diferent options to see our loaded object in the scene. Wireframe, Disable Textures, Cull Faces, Disable lights and disable Ambien Oclusion. 

-**Help**: this window let you clic a link to this amazing engine, and also open an About window that shows you the license of this project, the libraries used and a link to our github page.

-**GameObjects**: this window shows the objects created by number, and lets you click a button to see the specifics of the objects in the inspector.

-**Inspector**: this window show the specifics of the object that we are looking at. Currenty only Texture and Mesh components of an object are available, others such as Transform components are work in progress

## Drag&Drop Feature:

Models and textures can be dropped directly into the engine, a new game object per mesh in the model and the texture will also be applied into that model. Cetroleopter Engine supports .fbx for the objects and dds/.png for the textures, there are not more formats in our plan, but we would be glad to add some :-)

## Save & Load Features:

For now, it only saves and loads the configuration, but once we polish our game objects system we will introduce a feature to save the hole scene!

## Engine Controls:

- **W**: Move Forward

- **A**: Move Left

- **S**: Move Backwards

- **D**: Move Right

- **ALTL + Mouse Left Click**: Changes the Rotation of the Camera

- **Mouse Wheel Forward**: Camera Zoom Forward

- **Mouse Wheel Backward**: Camera Zoom Backwards
